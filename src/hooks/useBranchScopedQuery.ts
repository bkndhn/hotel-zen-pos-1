 * Hook that returns the current branch filter context for queries.

 * Behavior:
 * - When admin is in "All Branches" view, `branchFilterId` is null (don't filter).
 * - Otherwise, `branchFilterId` is the active branch id and queries should filter by it.
 * - `operatingBranchId` is what to write into new records (inserts).
 * - `readOnly` is true when in All-Branches view.
 *
 * Pass an `onChange` callback to refetch data when the user switches branches.
 * The callback is invoked AFTER React re-renders with the new branchFilterId,
 * so closures inside it will see the updated value.
